## FAQ

1. I hate Octopoid can I replace it? 

A= Sure, but not really on Novus, Novus was built with the idea of following community ideas, but also using a semi-open source model. Novus is built on top of Octopoid Software and Novifiam, although Novifiam is open source, Novus Backend is not, this means at least on _Novus_ you can't replace Octopoid, but if you do create your own fork with Novifiam. You are free to do it. 

2. Is Octopoid open source? 

A= Well yes and no, first you are looking at the source right now, second, most of the software that Octopoid uses to make Novus work is open source and it's linked below, if it is not open source, a reponse is addressed on my website. 

3. Why do I need Octopoid? 

A= Some of the software by Nyx (Team behind Novus), by me Diego Magdaleno or by a third party (Git by Linus for example) is hosted here, and some tweaks, themes or utilities need these dependencies in order to work correctly.
